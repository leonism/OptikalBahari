**leonism:** Explain to me how Jekyll's handle the flow process of turning the **styles.scss** in the **_sass folder**, than what is the main.scss does sits in the assets folder? before eventually turning into main.css? Please elaborate further

**Workspace:** Collecting workspace informationIn a Jekyll project, the process of handling SCSS (Sass) files and converting them into CSS files involves several steps. Here's a detailed explanation of the flow process:

### 1. **SCSS Files in _sass Folder**:

- The _sass folder contains partial SCSS files that are meant to be imported into other SCSS files. These partials typically start with an underscore (e.g., `_styles.scss`) and are not compiled directly into CSS files.
- These partials define variables, mixins, and styles that can be reused across the project.

### 2. **Main SCSS File in assets Folder**:

- The `main.scss` file in the `assets` folder is the primary SCSS file that imports all the partials from the `_sass` folder.
- The `main.scss` file typically looks like this:

```scss
// filepath: /Volumes/DATA/Jekyll/OptikalBahari/assets/main.scss
```
```scss
---
---
@import "styles";
```

- The `@import "styles";` statement imports the `_styles.scss` partial from the _sass folder.


### 3. **Jekyll's SCSS Processing**:

- Jekyll uses the [Jekyll Sass Converter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/) plugin to process SCSS files.
- When Jekyll builds the site, it looks for SCSS files in the assets folder and processes them.
- The main.scss file is processed by Jekyll, which resolves all the `@import` statements and combines the contents of the imported partials into a single CSS file.

### 4. **Output CSS File**:

- The processed **main.scss** file is converted into a `main.css` file.
- This `main.css` file is then placed in the assets folder, which is the output directory for the generated site.
- The `main.css` file contains all the styles defined in the imported partials and is ready to be used in the HTML files of the site.


### 5. **Including the CSS in HTML**:

- The generated `main.css` file is linked in the HTML files of the site using a `<link>` tag.
- For example, in the head.html file, you might have:
```html
<link  rel="stylesheet"  href="{{ '/assets/main.css' | relative_url }}">
```

In summary, the **main.scss** file in the **assets folder** serves as **the entry point** for importing all the SCSS partials from the **_sass** folder. Jekyll processes this file, resolves the imports, and generates a single `main.css` file, which is then included in the HTML files of the site. This process ensures that all the styles are combined and available for use in the final website.

**leonism: @workspace Can you explain the import order?**

**Workspace:** Collecting workspace information. Certainly! The import order in SCSS files is crucial because it determines how styles are applied and can affect the final output CSS. Let's break down the import order based on the provided files.

### main.scss

The **main.scss** file in the assets folder imports the `styles` partial:

```scss
---
---
@import "styles";
```
This means that main.scss will include the contents of styles.scss.


### styles.scss

Assuming **styles.scss** imports other partials, the order of these imports will determine the order in which styles are applied. For example, if styles.scss looks like this:

```scss
@import 'variables';
@import 'mixins';
@import 'global';
@import 'navbar';
@import 'masthead';
@import 'post';
@import 'footer';
@import 'whatsapp';
@import 'lazyload';
@import 'videos';
@import 'blinkies';
@import 'overlapping';
@import 'bootstrap-overrides';
@import 'hover';
@import 'maps';
@import 'pagination';
@import 'searchbar';
@import 'icons';
@import 'logo';
// @import "darkmode";
// @import "contact";
```

This means that the styles will be imported in the following order:

1. `variables.scss`
2. `mixins.scss`
3. `global.scss`
4. `navbar.scss`
5. `masthead.scss`
6. `post.scss`
7. `footer.scss`
8. `whatsapp.scss`
9. `lazyload.scss`
10. `videos.scss`
11. `blinkies.scss`
12. `overlapping.scss`
13. `bootstrap-overrides.scss`
14. `hover.scss`
15. `maps.scss`
16. `pagination.scss`
17. `searchbar.scss`
18. `icons.scss`
19. `logo.scss`
20. Optionally, `darkmode.scss` and `contact.scss` (if uncommented)

### Summary

The import order starts from `main.scss`, which imports `styles.scss`. The `styles.scss` file then imports various other partials in the specified order. This ensures that `variables` and `mixins` are defined before they are used in other partials, and that base styles are applied before component-specific styles.

By following this order, you ensure that your styles are applied correctly and consistently throughout your project.

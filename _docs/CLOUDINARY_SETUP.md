# Cloudinary Integration for Optikal Bahari

This guide explains how to set up and use Cloudinary for image management in the Optikal Bahari Jekyll site.

## Overview

Cloudinary provides:
- **Cloud Storage**: Store images in the cloud instead of your repository
- **Automatic Optimization**: Automatic format conversion (WebP, AVIF) and quality optimization
- **Responsive Images**: Generate multiple sizes for different devices
- **Fast CDN**: Global content delivery network for faster loading
- **Transformations**: Resize, crop, and apply effects on-the-fly

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Cloudinary Account

1. Sign up at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Get your credentials from the Dashboard:
   - Cloud Name
   - API Key
   - API Secret

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` with your Cloudinary credentials:
   ```bash
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   JEKYLL_ENV=development
   ```

3. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` (already included)

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

This will install the Cloudinary gem added to your Gemfile.

### 4. Migrate Existing Images (Optional)

To upload your existing images to Cloudinary:

```bash
# Install dotenv gem for the migration script
gem install dotenv

# Run the migration
ruby _scripts/migrate_to_cloudinary.rb
```

This will:
- Upload all images from `assets/img/` to Cloudinary
- Organize them in folders (posts, backgrounds, icons, etc.)
- Generate logs and URL mappings
- Preserve your local images as backup

## Usage

### 1. Liquid Filters

#### Basic Cloudinary URL
```liquid
{{ '/assets/img/image.jpg' | cloudinary_url }}
```

#### With transformations
```liquid
{{ '/assets/img/image.jpg' | cloudinary_url: width=400, height=300, crop='fill' }}
```

#### Using presets
```liquid
{{ '/assets/img/image.jpg' | cloudinary_preset: 'hero' }}
{{ '/assets/img/image.jpg' | cloudinary_preset: 'thumbnail' }}
{{ '/assets/img/image.jpg' | cloudinary_preset: 'card' }}
```

#### Responsive images
```liquid
{{ '/assets/img/image.jpg' | cloudinary_responsive }}
```

### 2. Cloudinary Tag

```liquid
{% cloudinary src='/assets/img/image.jpg' width=800 height=600 crop='fill' %}
```

### 3. Include Template (Recommended)

Use the responsive image include for best results:

```liquid
{% include cloudinary_image.html
   src="/assets/img/hero-image.jpg"
   alt="Hero image description"
   preset="hero"
   class="img-fluid rounded" %}
```

#### Include Parameters

- `src`: Image path (required)
- `alt`: Alt text (required)
- `class`: CSS classes (optional, defaults to "img-fluid")
- `preset`: Use predefined preset (thumbnail, card, hero, full)
- `width`: Custom width
- `height`: Custom height
- `loading`: Loading attribute (lazy, eager, defaults to lazy)
- `responsive`: Generate responsive srcset (true/false, defaults to true)

### 4. Available Presets

- **thumbnail**: 200x200, cropped and centered
- **card**: 400x300, cropped and centered
- **hero**: 1200x600, cropped and centered
- **full**: 1920px wide, maintains aspect ratio

## Environment-Based Usage

### Development
- Set `JEKYLL_ENV=development`
- Images will use local files for faster development
- Cloudinary integration is available but not enforced

### Production
- Set `JEKYLL_ENV=production`
- Images will automatically use Cloudinary URLs
- Automatic optimization and responsive images

## File Organization in Cloudinary

Images are organized in folders:
- `optikalbahari/posts/` - Blog post images
- `optikalbahari/backgrounds/` - Background images
- `optikalbahari/icons/` - Icons and small graphics
- `optikalbahari/testimonials/` - Testimonial photos
- `optikalbahari/profile/` - Profile and team photos
- `optikalbahari/` - General images

## Best Practices

### 1. Image Naming
- Use descriptive filenames
- Use hyphens instead of spaces
- Include relevant keywords

### 2. Alt Text
- Always provide meaningful alt text
- Describe the image content and context
- Keep it concise but descriptive

### 3. Responsive Images
- Use the responsive include template
- Let Cloudinary handle different sizes
- Specify appropriate `sizes` attribute

### 4. Performance
- Use `loading="lazy"` for images below the fold
- Use `loading="eager"` for above-the-fold images
- Choose appropriate presets for your use case

## Troubleshooting

### Images not loading
1. Check your environment variables
2. Verify Cloudinary credentials
3. Ensure images are uploaded to Cloudinary
4. Check the browser console for errors

### Migration issues
1. Ensure you have the `dotenv` gem installed
2. Check your `.env` file configuration
3. Verify file permissions on the assets directory
4. Check the error log generated by the migration script

### Local development
- Images will fall back to local files if Cloudinary is not configured
- Set `JEKYLL_ENV=development` to use local images
- Use `JEKYLL_ENV=production` to test Cloudinary integration

## Advanced Configuration

Edit `_config_cloudinary.yml` to customize:
- Default transformations
- Responsive breakpoints
- Image presets
- Folder structure

## Support

For issues with:
- **Cloudinary service**: Check [Cloudinary documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation)
- **Jekyll integration**: Review the plugin code in `_plugins/cloudinary.rb`
- **Site-specific issues**: Check the generated log files
